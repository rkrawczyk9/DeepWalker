## DeepWalker
Work In Progress! Just making this public so people can use my code as an example.

# Overview

I'm building a framework to teach a character to walk using deep learning, in a physics-based environment, with animation reference.

The main stuff is in deepwalker_env.py. That's where all the interaction with pybullet happens. There are also occasionally alright comments sprinkled throughout the files, explaining what's going on. Once this project is closer to completion I'll flesh out some real documentation. At the moment, just having fun.

For the animation retargeting side of this project, check out my other repo [DeepWalkerAnims](https://github.com/rkrawczyk9/DeepWalkerAnims)

Hit me up if you're interested in this stuff / also trying something in the ML or Animation space!


# Ignore
tray_panda.py is not really part of the project, it's just a previous project I did to learn how to use pybullet and ML.
